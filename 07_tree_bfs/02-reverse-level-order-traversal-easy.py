Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its level-by-level traversal
 in reverse order, i.e., the lowest level comes first.

You should populate the values of all nodes in each level from left to right in
separate sub-arrays.

"""
Time complexity 
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. 
This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.
Space complexity 
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. 
We will also need O(N) space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), 
therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.
